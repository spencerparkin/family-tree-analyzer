Case #1
=======
More information is needed on K2J9-JRM (Louise Zahler) before her ordinances can become available, but I don't understand why.  I inquired of the ward family history consultant, but he didn't know either.

Case #2 (RESOLVED)
=======
Joseph Hyrum Parkin (KWNY-S7B) was borth 6th of June, 1850, and according to FamilySearch.org, he does not need to be sealed to his parents, because he was "born in the covenant."  However, his parents, John Parkin and Elizabeth Write Brown were sealed 1st of May, 1873.  Their secular marriage was on the 28th of February, 1839, so he was not born out of wed-lock, but it does not look like he was born in the covenant.  I asked the ward family history consultant about this, but he did not know the answer.  I called FamilySearch.org, but they did not know either.  They suggested I submit an inquery through the website, and I have, and am now awaiting a response from that.  It is likely that he is sealed to his parents, but I would still like the data inconsistency to be resolved.  Alternatively, it might not hert to perform the ordinance anyway.

I just got a response from FamilySearch.org Data Administration.  They told me they deleted the "Born in the Covenant (BIC)" indicator from Joseph's record, but said absolutely nothing else.  Curious what they replaced it with, I looked at Joseph's record on FamilySearch.org, and saw there a date for his cealing to parents (13th of March, 1914, Salt Lake Temple).  This was during his lifetime, so he obviously participated.

Why was this wrong in the first place?  Where did they get the new information?  They sure didn't say much.  I'm guessing they were able to resolve the matter by looking at some sort of official church membership record database or something, but I really don't know.  Anyhow, case closed.
